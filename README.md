Driving Scene Understanding: How much temporal context and spatial resolution is
necessary?

Accepted at `Canadian AI 2021`

## Abstract
Driving Scene Understanding is a broad field which addresses the problem of
recognizing a variety of on-road situations; namely driver behaviour/intention
recognition, driver-action causal reasoning, pedestrians’ and nearby vehicles’
intention recognition, etc. Many existing works propose excellent AI based
solutions to these interesting problems by leveraging visual data along with
other modalities. However, very few researchers venture into determining the
necessary metadata of the visual inputs to their models. This work attempts to
put forward some useful insights about the required spatial resolution and
temporal context/depth of the visual data for Driving Scene Understanding.
